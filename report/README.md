LogProcessing Map-Reduce is a Collection of Map Reduce program to process Log Files and extract information. This project can be configured to work with Log Files of multiple types without any changes to the Code base, and just by modifying the applications.config file.

This project was done as part of __CS441 Engineering Distributed Objects for Cloud Computing__ under Professor Dr. Mark Grechanik at The University of Illinois at Chicago.
